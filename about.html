            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Swathi, and I’m a passionate Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in front-end web development. From an early age, I have been captivated by technology and the impact it has on our everyday lives. This curiosity led me to pursue a career in computer science, where I’m learning to combine problem-solving skills with creative design to build user-friendly and visually appealing websites.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout my studies, I’ve developed a solid foundation in core web technologies, particularly HTML and CSS, which I use to create clean, responsive layouts and engaging user interfaces. I am fascinated by the process of turning ideas into interactive websites, where every detail—down to the color choices, spacing, and typography—plays a role in creating an exceptional user experience.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, I am focused on expanding my skill set to include JavaScript and other front-end frameworks, with the goal of becoming a versatile front-end developer. I enjoy working on projects where I can challenge myself creatively while also applying the technical skills I’ve gained. I believe that continuous learning is essential in the ever-evolving field of web development, and I am always eager to explore new tools, technologies, and best practices.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of coding, I love participating in hackathons and attending tech meetups to connect with like-minded individuals and stay updated on the latest industry trends. I am a strong advocate for user-centered design and am dedicated to building websites that are not only visually appealing but also accessible and easy to navigate for all users.</p>
        
            <p>With a growth mindset and a drive to innovate, I am excited to take on new projects and collaborate with others to create impactful digital experiences. My ultimate goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference, whether by enhancing user experience on a personal website or working as part of a larger development team on applications that serve a broader purpose.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was my first step into the world of front-end development. I built a responsive, user-friendly personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and background. My primary goal was to create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate site that would represent my personal brand while providing potential collaborators and employers with a clear overview of my work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using HTML and CSS, I designed and implemented a clean layout, focusing on responsive design principles to ensure the website looks and functions well across various devices. I added navigation with anchor links to allow seamless scrolling between sections and utilized CSS for visual effects, including hover states and subtle animations. Hosting the site on GitHub Pages helped me learn the basics of deployment and web hosting.

            <!-- Project 2: To-Do List Application -->
            <div class="project">
                <h3>To-Do List Application</h3>
                <p>
                    I developed a simple yet functional to-do list web application to manage tasks and enhance productivity. This project allowed me to explore how front-end development could solve everyday problems by creating an interactive and user-centered experience. The application enables users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, helping them organize their daily activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to add interactivity. Building this app helped me understand the basics of DOM manipulation and the concept of event-driven programming. I also focused on designing an intuitive interface with clear task management functionalities, enhancing the user experience by ensuring that the interface is simple and straightforward.

            <!-- Project 3: Responsive Landing Page Design -->
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Responsive Landing Page Design</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involved designing a landing page for a hypothetical product or service, emphasizing responsive design and layout aesthetics. My objective was to create a professional-looking landing page that would look great on any device. I approached this by creating a mobile-first design and testing on multiple screen sizes to ensure a consistent look and feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I implemented a modern, clean design with a hero section, information sections, and a call-to-action button to mimic the structure of real-world landing pages. This project strengthened my understanding of CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout management, as well as media queries to achieve a responsive design. I also learned how to balance visual appeal with functionality, ensuring the page communicates information effectively.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid), Media Queries</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Enhanced my skills in responsive design and layout structuring, preparing me for building real-world, mobile-friendly websites.</p>

            <!-- Project 4: Basic E-commerce Product Page (Optional) -->
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Basic E-commerce Product Page</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my journey to understand e-commerce and dynamic content layout, I created a basic e-commerce product page. This page displays a list of products, each with a photo, title, price, and short description. I designed it to offer a clean and straightforward browsing experience for users interested in a product's features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The page uses HTML and CSS for structure and design, with additional styling to make the layout visually appealing. Although no back-end was involved, I created this project to understand the structure of an e-commerce site and enhance my CSS styling skills. I also experimented with hover effects and button styling to make the page more interactive.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> HTML, CSS</p>
